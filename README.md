# BoundingSphereTest
2D and 3D test of Welzl Minimum Bounding Circle/Sphere

An implementation of Welzl's Minimum Bounding Ball algorithm.
The code is based on the gamedev.net article Welzl - http://www.gamedev.net/page/resources/_/technical/graphics-programming-and-theory/welzl-r2484

## Controls:
* R - generates new random points
* C - calculates bounding shape
* F - switches between 2D and 3D
In 3D mode
* W,A,S,D - moves camera
* Mouse - rotates camera

## Requirements:
GLM, FreeGLUT and GLEW
