# BoundingSphereTest
2D and 3D test of Welzl Minimum Bounding Cicle/Sphere

An implementation of Welzl's Minimum Bounding Ball algorithm.
The code is based on the gamedev.net article Welzl - http://www.gamedev.net/page/resources/_/technical/graphics-programming-and-theory/welzl-r2484

Controls:
R - generates new random points
C - calculates bounding shape
F - swtichesb etween 2D and 3D
In 3D mode
W,A,S,D - moves camera
Mouse - rotates camera


Requires GLM, FreeGLUT and GLEW to compile. Release build runs.
